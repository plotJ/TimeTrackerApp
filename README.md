# Time Tracker App

The Time Tracker App is a simple web application that allows users to track the time they spend working on various tasks. The idea for this app was conceived as a tool to help track the time spent on a coding journey each day.

## Features

- Start, stop, and resume a timer with the click of a button
- Display a log of the time spent working each day
- Store the log data in a cookie to remember time spent on previous days
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices

## How to use

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Click the "Start" button to start the timer.
3. Click the "Stop" button to stop the timer. The time spent working will be added to the log below the timer.
4. To resume the timer, click the "Start" button again. The timer will continue from where it left off.
